  Actual frozen power:

  Changes:

    - Added descriptions to all zinc pipings since people don't read the tech descriptions.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.1
Date: 2025-06-20
  Actual frozen power:

  Additions:
    - Fully implemented the Cryovolcanic Turbine. This special power building exclusive to Paracelsin generates power from the warmer water produced by the Cryovolcanoes.
    - Fully implemented the Burner Pumpjack, a new faster but highly inefficient pumpjack useful to kickstart Paracelsin.

  Changes:
    - Solar power on Paracelsin is now zero. Sorry guys :3.
    - Cryovolcanoes now release 30°C Water.

  Fixes:
    - Fixed placement issues with the Paracelsin Briefing tips and tricks when other planet mods were installed.
    - Fixed the zinc plate recipe appearing in the crafting menu since the start of the game.

  Notes:
    - The Cryovolcanic Turbine may be fully reworked in the future so don't rely on them too much.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.0
Date: 2025-06-19
  Frozen power and inefficient melting:

  Additions:
    - Added the Sphalerite and Tetrahedrite melting recipes, to directly obtain molten iron and copper from the ores. They will be very inefficient compared to melting the ores obtained from their processing, but will not give off any byproducts. Nitric acid is needed for the recipe alongside calcite.

  Changes:
    - Solar power on Paracelsin is now one to fix some issues.

  Notes:
    - The code now contains two new entities, the Burner Pumpjack and Cryovolcanic Turbine. These two will be unused until I manage to make the Turbine work correctly. If anyone can help I'll gladly appreciate the help. The graphics mod will be updated with the Turbine's textures, alongside the new recipes'.

Date: 2025-06-04
  Nitric acid more like MYTHIC acid:

  Additions:
    - Compatibility with Cerys, nitric acid will be made into the same fluid as in Cerys when both are installed.

  Changes:
    - Concrete from molten iron is now part of concrete productivity. I forgot abt it lol.
    - Gave a fuel value... to sulfur. Yeah. Sulfur. You can burn it now. Not much value but at least you can use the overflow from zinc processing for something else. What? Sulfur dioxide? Acid rains? It's pronounced biter repellant. Or maybe they like it? Don't ask me I'm no biterologist.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.2
Date: 2025-06-03
  It's the little things you always forget about:

    - Now actually added the crowdin translation access like advertised (i forgor).

  Changes:
    - Changed the 10 solid fuel in the Nitric Acid Rocket Fuel recipe to 5 solid fuel and 5 sulfur, so you can deal with any extra sulfur from zinc processing.
    - Reduced the amount of carbon needed to craft zinc to 4.
