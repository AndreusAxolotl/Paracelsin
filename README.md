### Temporary warnings: The mod just released so there may be big bugs, warn me if you find them. The mod is currently running on an experimental version of the game, so if you have issues just update to 2.0.50 or above. I'm currently accepting suggestions for new recipes and rewards. Just put them in an issue/pr/factorio mod browser discussion!!

Another frozen world on the horizon... Paracelsin is much colder than Aquilo, but unlike the world of ammonia this planet has a solid surface.
Highly active cryovolcanically, the planet eerily resembles Vulcanus but instead of lava and sulfuric acid the planet is covered by ice and liquid nitrogen.

# Paracelsin

This mod adds planet Paracelsin, the world of Zinc, and its various resources and processes!

Should be safe to add in an already started save!

On the world of Zinc you'll have to make your way between heating up your factory in the cold, dealing with endless byproducts and solving the puzzle of zinc's long production chain.

Many rewards will come from conquering the frozen wasteland of nitrogen and zinc, from a new repair pack to longer insulated pipes!

# PLEASE REPORT ANY BUGS YOU FIND

## Compat:
- [Age of Production](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Age-of-Production): Solves a bit of recipe category mayhem.
- [Cerys Moon of Fulgora](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Cerys-Moon-of-Fulgora): Cerys' nitric acid gets replaced by Paracelsin's.

### Future Plans:
- Adding more rewards
- Maybe reworking the planet's generation.
- Compatibility with other mods.

### Translation
- [You can find Paracelsin here for translation purposes, just translate it to your language and send it in, its locale will be updated in the following updates!](https://crowdin.com/project/factorio-mods-localization)
