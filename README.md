### Temporary warnings: The mod just released so there may be big bugs, warn me if you find them. The mod is currently running on an experimental version of the game, so if you have issues just update to 2.0.50 or above. I'm currently accepting suggestions for new recipes and rewards. Just put them in an issue/pr/factorio mod browser discussion!!

Another frozen world on the horizon... Paracelsin is much colder than Aquilo, but unlike the world of ammonia this planet has a solid surface.
Highly active cryovolcanically, the planet eerily resembles Vulcanus but instead of lava and sulfuric acid the planet is covered by ice and liquid nitrogen.

# Paracelsin

This mod adds planet Paracelsin, the world of Zinc, and its various resources and processes!

Should be safe to add in an already started save!

On the world of Zinc you'll have to make your way between heating up your factory in the cold, dealing with endless byproducts and solving the puzzle of zinc's long production chain.

Many rewards will come from conquering the frozen wasteland of nitrogen and zinc, from a new repair pack to longer insulated pipes!

## Planet

Paracelsin is located farther than Fulgora in space. You can reach it from Fulgora or Nauvis, but beware of the large asteroids on the way. Make sure to bring something to keep you warm, as just like Aquilo, your machines won't work unless heated.

## Resources

Paracelsin includes the following resources, though not all can be directly obtained
- Sphalerite, essential to get any iron on the planet
- Tetrahedrite, required to obtain copper
- Zinc, which must be extracted and processed from the above
- Sulfur, a by-product of Sphalerite and Tetrahedrite processing
- Vaterite, a mineral not unlike Calcite
- Nitrogen, which must be pumped from the shores
- Water cryovolcano wells, requiring pumpjacks to be extracted

Zinc is very good at handling all sorts of fluid, so you can make pipes, pumps, and storage tanks with it. In fact, Zinc pipes are so that they won't freeze on cold surfaces like Paracelsin or Aquilo!

## New recipes

Paracelsin gives you a lot of new recipes to add to your industry:

- Sphalerite Processing
  Add Steam, and it gives you Zinc Concentrate, Iron Ore, and Sulfur
- Tetrahedrite Processing
  Add Steam, and it gives you Zinc Concentrate, Copper Ore, and Sulfur
- Vaterite Processing
  With Water, it lets you process down the Vaterite into Calcite and Carbon.
- Nitric acid
  Made from Nitrogen, Water, and Vaterite, Nitric Acid can be used to make a few recipes
- Plastic from Nitric Acid
  Add some Water and Carbon, and you get 2 plastic bars
- Solid Fuel from Nitrogen
  With Vaterite in the mix, that's an easy source of Solid Fuel
- Rocket Fuel from Nitric Acid
  You'll still need Solid Fuel, as well as Water and Sulfur to make this
- Zinc Leaching
  This is how you get Dirty Zinc Solution; for that you'll need Zinc Concentrate, Nitric Acid, and Calcite
- Zinc Purification
  Add Steam and Copper Cable to the Dirty Zinc Solution to get Zinc Solution (and Stone, as a by-product)
- Zinc
  Use Zinc Solution with Carbon to get the coveted Zinc
- Zinc Plate
  Simply turn raw Zinc into plates!
- Zinc Rivet
  Use Zinc Plates and Iron Sticks to make these
- Zinc Solder
  Zinc Plates and Copper Cables will give you Solder
- Electric Coil
  You'll need the Zinc Rivets and Solder, Iron Gear Wheels, Copper Cables, and Nitric Acid for the Electric Coils
- Galvanization Science Pack
  Finally, use your Electric Coils with Concrete and even more Nitric Acid for the new science pack

You can cast galvanized Iron Gear Wheels, Iron Sticks, Low Density Structures, and Steel Plates with Zinc and other Paracelsin products.

## New Machines

Paracelsin comes with two new buildings for further automation: the Electrochemical Plant and the Mechanical Plant

Aside from being useful (and even necessary) for this planet's products, they can be used for some base game stuff:

The Electrochemical Plant can make Concrete (and its Refined variant), Plastic, Sulfur and Sulfuric Acid, and Batteries.

The Mechanical Plant, on the other hand, can make engines, express belts, all types of inserters, all types of pipes, storage tanks, and pumps, and even flying frames and the robot themselves; it can also make repair packs, low density structures, and rail (elevated too)

# PLEASE REPORT ANY BUGS YOU FIND

## Compat:
- [Age of Production](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Age-of-Production): Solves a bit of recipe category mayhem.
- [Cerys Moon of Fulgora](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Cerys-Moon-of-Fulgora): Cerys' nitric acid gets replaced by Paracelsin's.

### Future Plans:
- Adding more rewards
- Maybe reworking the planet's generation.
- Compatibility with other mods.

### Translation
- [You can find Paracelsin here for translation purposes, just translate it to your language and send it in, its locale will be updated in the following updates!](https://crowdin.com/project/factorio-mods-localization)
