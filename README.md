Another frozen world on the horizon... Paracelsin is much colder than Aquilo, but unlike the world of ammonia this planet has a solid surface.
Highly active cryovolcanically, the planet eerily resembles Vulcanus but instead of lava and sulfuric acid the planet is covered by ice and liquid nitrogen.

# Paracelsin

This mod adds planet Paracelsin, the world of Zinc, and its various resources and processes!

Should be safe to add in an already started save but some recipes will have some ingredients added and some techs will also require the new science pack.

On the world of Zinc you'll have to make your way between heating up your factory in the cold, dealing with endless byproducts and solving the puzzle of zinc's long production chain.

Many rewards will come from conquering the frozen wasteland of nitrogen and zinc, from a new repair pack to longer insulated pipes!

## Planet

Paracelsin is located farther than Aquilo in space. You can reach it from Fulgora or Aquilo, but beware of the large asteroids on the way. Make sure to bring something to keep you warm, as just like Aquilo, your machines won't work unless heated.

## Resources

Paracelsin includes the following resources:
- Sphalerite, compound of zinc, iron and sulfur
- Tetrahedrite, compound of copper, zinc and sulfur
- Vaterite, a mineral not unlike Calcite
- Nitrogen, which must be pumped from the shallow lakes on the surface
- Water cryovolcanoes, ejecting water that can be extracted via pumpjack

## New Machines

Paracelsin comes with two new buildings for further automation: the Electrochemical Plant and the Mechanical Plant

Aside from being useful (and even necessary) for this planet's products, they can be used for some base game stuff:

The Electrochemical Plant can make Concrete (and its Refined variant), Plastic, Sulfur and Sulfuric Acid, and Batteries.

The Mechanical Plant, on the other hand, can make engines, express belts, all types of inserters, all types of pipes, storage tanks, and pumps, and even flying frames and the robot themselves; it can also make repair packs, low density structures, and rail (elevated too)
