The planet is rich in [item=sphalerite] and [item=tetrahedrite], compounds of [item=zinc], and [item=vaterite]. [entity=water-cryovolcano]es can also be found dotting the surface.
fulgoran-log=Inside the [entity=crashed-fulgoran-pod], alongside the blueprints, you found a message. You could translate it thanks to the research done on Fulgora: "Greetings to all lifeforms that may find this. We are the Fulgorans and we sent these pods to this frozen wasteland to search for oil. Our search for growth brought some minor consequences to our planet's environment, not that we care, but also exhausted most of our beloved oil supplies and gathered ourselves somewhat of a backup of the byproducts of its processing. If you do know a place with oil, please contact our nearest planetary outpost. If your planet is currently not capable of space travel, please send this message to one who does. And if we're dead by then... Well I doubt we could fail." You and the Fulgorans would've been great friends.
