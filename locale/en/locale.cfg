[space-location-name]
paracelsin=Paracelsin

[space-location-description]
paracelsin=A highly cryovolcanically active frozen wasteland. Lakes of [fluid=nitrogen] cover the surface, flowing from an underground ocean. [entity=water-cryovolcano]es dot the surface alongside veins of [item=tetrahedrite] and [item=sphalerite], essential for the extraction of [item=zinc]. [item=vaterite] is also present in small veins. Anything built on the planet must be constantly kept warm or it will freeze and all unwanted byproducts of zinc extraction must be disposed of.
